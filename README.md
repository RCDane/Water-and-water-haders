# Water-shader
What is this project? \
An example project of a water shader

# Goal / Motivation
My goal was to create a water shader without using any textures, meaning everything from the noise generation for the waves to the normal map had to be generated in shader.

This shader was a part of a bigger project which is on hold. This being in the best condition for show of.

# Features:
- Wave displacement
- Wave speed
- Normal map generation
- Water transparency
- Underwater fog
- Fresnel effect (color difference, between looking directly into water and at an angle)

# Example
